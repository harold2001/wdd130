Topics that my personal website will cover:

1. My skills
2. My projects
3. How to contact me
Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. Let me tell you what you will see from now on: the reason why I am the candidate that fits your projects or company.

To start, I want to tell you that one of the reasons why you should be on my website is because here you will find skills, projects, and good practices when programming.

I believe that some of the things you expect to see on my website have to do with a candidate who will influence your company in such a way as to take it to the next level. To tell the truth, I can't tell you that I am the perfect worker. I think that no one is, but I do believe that I am the one who, when he has a goal, pursues it until he achieves it, and I can assure you that that will be a very important value that I can bring to you.

Some of the activities you probably want to complete on my website will have to do with seeing my skills converted into projects, seeing the code I've written, and if necessary, having a way to contact me. Let me tell you that this website focuses on giving you what it takes to accomplish it.

There is information that I consider very necessary for my website to offer so that you, my dear visitor, can obtain what you are looking for. For example, you need to have a list of the skills that I have learned over the course of my career as a web developer. In addition, it is very important that you see a very friendly and intuitive list of my public projects carried out over the course of my time as a programmer. Lastly, I consider that having a way to contact me, such as by phone number, email, Facebook, and LinkedIn, is of utmost importance.

At this point, you may be wondering, why should I spend my time getting this information from this website instead of looking for it elsewhere? Given this, I would like to tell you that my website offers a wide variety of technologies that I have learned during my career, which can give you the security that whoever you will work with is someone you trust who seeks the best performance and scalability of the projects you work on. So if you want to see this, and much more, I invite you to stay on my website.

I want to tell you what technologies and/or skills I have learned over the course of my time as a web developer: HTML, CSS, responsive web design, JavaScript, React, NextJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, PHP, Laravel, Inertia, NodeJS, Express, MySQL, SQL, Object-Oriented Programming, and Model-View-Controller Architecture. These are some of the many that I have learned in my time as a web programmer. My inclination has been more towards the backend side; However, I am sure that I can perform very well in the Frontend, so if I am required to do a project of that type, I am capable of getting involved.

Additionally, I want you to know about my public projects, which help you see my skills put into practice. I started with landing pages like a recipe for cheesecake and a simple home page. Then I started using JavaScript and made calculators, and a simple game using an API. I improved my skills using React, by making a multi-view application using react-router, a library to route an application in React, I also consumed an API to make a weather application, which I have still been improving. It should be noted that for these projects I have used Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Finally, I have carried out several projects using PHP, which includes everything from a simple login system to a platform for a university that includes user roles. I have used Laravel to improve the same projects that I did with pure PHP, and I have perfected my technique by learning about the Laravel ORM (Eloquent), along with the templating engine it uses (Blade). Additionally, I started using Livewire, which allows me to improve a Laravel application by making it more interactive with the user.

Finally, let me give you my phone number: +51993779470; my email: hcarazasnires@gmail.com; and my profile on Facebook and LinkedIn is Harold Carazas.

I would be happy to have a conversation about how I can support your projects.

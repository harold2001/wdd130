            Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. Let me tell you what you will
            see from now on: the reason why I am the candidate that fits your
            projects or company.
          </p>

          <h4>What you'll find here</h4>
          <p>
            To start, I want to tell you that one of the reasons why you should
            be on my website is because here you will find skills, projects, and
            good practices when programming.
          </p>

        <div id="goodCandidate" class="findSection-card">
          <div><img src="./images/page1/svg/flag.svg" alt="" /></div>
          <h4>A good candidate</h4>
          <p>
            I believe that some of the things you expect to see on my website
            have to do with a candidate who will influence your company in such
            a way as to take it to the next level. To tell the truth, I can't
            tell you that I am the perfect worker. I think that no one is, but I
            do believe that I am the one who, when he has a goal, pursues it
            until he achieves it, and I can assure you that that will be a very
            important value that I can bring to you.
          </p>

        <div id="projectsMore" class="findSection-card">
          <div><img src="./images/page1/svg/star.svg" alt="" /></div>
          <h4>Projects and more</h4>
          <p>
            Additionally, some of the activities you probably want to complete
            on my website will have to do with seeing my skills converted into
            projects, seeing the code I've written, and if necessary, having a
            way to contact me. Let me tell you that this website focuses on
            giving you what it takes to accomplish it.

          There is information that I consider very necessary for my website to
          offer so that you, my dear visitor, can obtain what you are looking
          for. For example, you need to have a list of the skills that I have
          learned over the course of my career as a web developer. In addition,
          it is very important that you see a very friendly and intuitive list
          of my public projects carried out over the course of my time as a
          programmer. Lastly, I consider that having a way to contact me, such
          as by phone number, email, Facebook, and LinkedIn, is of utmost
          importance.

              Why should I get this information on this website? Why not look
              elsewhere?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I would like to tell you that my website offers a wide variety of
              technologies that I have learned during my career, which can give
              you the security that whoever you will work with is someone you
              trust who seeks the best performance and scalability of the
              projects you work on. So, if you want to see this, and much more,
              I invite you to stay on my website.
